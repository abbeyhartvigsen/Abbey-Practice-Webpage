<h1>Post #1</h1>
<h2>Today I am going to discuss to review my favorite book "Dark Life" by Cat Falls.</h2>
<p>This book is amazing. I love the setting of an underwater western set in the future. It is amazing. The characters and themes are also great. For example, Ty, the main character, has lived his whole life in the underwater settlement and has developed a special "Dark Gift." However, he is afraid to tell his parents because of potential reprussions such as having to move "Topside" and be experimented on by doctors.</p>
<p>In addition, some  of the main themes include global warming, being yourself in a world that could use your gifts against you, and how some people mistreat others. </p>
<p>"Dark Life" by Kat Falls is an amazing book filled with underwater adventures, romance, great characters, and interesting themes. </p>
